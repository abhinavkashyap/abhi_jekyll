Our paper "UDAPTER: Efficient Domain Adaptation using Adapters" has been accepted for EACL'23. 
This paper aims to make domain adaptation more efficient. This is a joint work with [Bhavitvtya Malik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavitvya-malik-698b5bb?originalSubdomain=in). 
Code, paper and everything nice, coming soon.
