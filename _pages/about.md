I am a Research Scientist at ASUS-AICS. I am also a part-time fifth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/){:target="\_blank"}. I closely collaborate with [Devamanyu Hazarika](https://www.devamanyu.com){:target="\_blank"} and [Soujanya Poria](https://sporia.info/). My research focuses on Natural Language Processing. 

Specifically I make NLP models robust under different domains, also called Domain Adaptation. 
I am interested in using unsupervised data from different domains for domain adaptation. My recent interest focuses on 
using parameter efficient learning methods for domain adaptation of Large Language Models. 

In AICS, I work on Clinical Natural Language Processing. If you want to know more about this reserach and for collaborations, email me.



### Previously,

I have done an internship at Amazon, with the Alexa AI team. I completed my Master's degree from the National University of Singapore. His master's thesis involved extractive summarization specific to restaurant reviews. I was part of the [Sensor Enhanced Social Media(SeSaMe)](){:target="\_blank"} lab with [Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/){:target="\_blank"}

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
