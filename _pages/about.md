I am a fourth year PhD student advised by Prof [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/){:target="\_blank"}. I also closely collaborate with [Devamanyu Hazarika](https://www.devamanyu.com){:target="\_blank"}. My research is on Natural Language Processing. I focus on making NLP models robust under different domains. NLP models do not perform well when presented with data from different domains and my focus is on Domain Adaptation for NLP. I am also interested in Scholarly Document Processing.

### Previously,

I completed my Masters from the National University of Singapore. My master's thesis involved extractive summarization specific to restaurant reviews. I was part of the [Sensor Enhanced Social Media(SeSaMe)](){:target="\_blank"} lab with [Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/){:target="\_blank"}

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
